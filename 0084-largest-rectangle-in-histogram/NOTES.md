â€‹- we can use a stack-based approach to efficiently find the maximum area.
- We iterate through each bar in the histogram and maintain a stack of indices.
- For each bar, we compare its height with the bar at the top of the stack.
- If the current bar's height is greater than the bar at the top of the stack, we push its index onto the stack.
- If the current bar's height is smaller, we pop indices from the stack until we find a bar whose height is smaller or equal to the current bar.
- For each popped index, we calculate the area using the height of the bar at that index and the width as the difference between the current index and the index at the top of the stack.
- We keep track of the maximum area encountered so far.

 **Pseudocode**:
 
   ```
   maxArea = 0
   stack = []
   For each bar in the histogram:
       While stack is not empty and current bar's height is less than the bar at the top of the stack:
           Pop index from stack
           Calculate area using popped index and current index
           Update maxArea if calculated area is greater
       Push current index onto stack
   While stack is not empty:
       Pop index from stack
       Calculate area using popped index and width as difference between current index and index at the top of the stack
       Update maxArea if calculated area is greater
   Return maxArea
   ```

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The optimized approach using a stack has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
   - This is because each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

6. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity of the optimized approach is O(n) where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
   - This is because the stack can potentially hold all the indices of the bars in the histogram.

7. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - Check for edge cases such as an empty histogram or a histogram with only one bar.
